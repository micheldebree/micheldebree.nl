# Michel de Bree

## Freelance Full Stack Java Developer

Full stack software developer with 20+ years of experience in complex and
dynamic IT landscapes, who thrives on working on challenging agile projects as
part of a multi-disciplinary team.

My technical experience ranges a full development stack. From, for example,
provisioning a Linux based server architecture, to developing service-oriented
JEE, to implementing a REST API driven Javascript front end. As a developer I
am at my best developing backend services and integrating them with other
components, while also being involved in the whole development stack.

My experience mainly involves customer facing internet channels that integrate
reliably and securely with back office systems, in the field of logistics,
telecommunication, banking, medical and public sector. In my daily work I
frequently communicate with business analysts as well as the IT department and
suppliers of my clients. I often have an advisory role concerning system- and
software architecture.

I prefer to work in a motivated, multi-disciplinary, self-directing team with a
clear focus on business value, in close collaboration with the various
stakeholders. I often find myself in the role of lead developer. I am also
constantly looking to improve the quality of solutions and the development
process while at the same time delivering real business value.

My broad experience and creative nature allows me to quickly assess different
options and make balanced decisions based on best practices, innovation, fit/gap
for the specific situation and the expected return on investment.

While working for the Standaard Platform Alliance, I am now mostly busy as Lead
Developer and Scrum Master in a development team for designing and building the
central integration hub for applications in the "Digitaal Stelsel Omgevingswet",
which supports the new "Omgevingswet" for 2019. This will land on the "Standaard
Platform". The main focus of the hub is routing, access-control, auditing and
self-service for service providers and service consumers. As such it has high
demands on availability, performance, scalability, security and privacy. Also I
work closely with the Standaard Platform teams for designing new features in the
platform that support the use cases for the Digitaal Stelsel Omgevingswet.

review, technical design, writing technical and functional documentation,
quality control of code, versioning and DTAP street.

This generic platform is based on the Java platform and open source components.
It is scalable, reliable and secure according to industry standards. A new
instance of the platform, consisting of several virtual Linux servers in a cloud
environment, is provisioned fully automatic from scratch and works out-of-the
box. A central governance solution is included for automatic deployment through
the DTAP cycle and central configuration and management of the business
applications that are hosted on the platform.
