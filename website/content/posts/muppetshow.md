A cover of the theme from [The
Muppetshow](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074028/), made for the successor of
the Commodore 64 demo [Mahna Mahna](/posts/mahnamahna),
called [Subway Art](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=205027)

Again, the music was done by [Animal](https://csdb.dk/scener/?id=35839). Nobody
knows it's my alter ego, except you, so hush hush...
