It has been about 30 years since [Yavin](https://csdb.dk/scener/?id=1126) and I
collaborated on a [Commodore 64](/tags/c64) tune, so to celebrate, here is a new
tune!

This is our entry to the ["Last Night" melody
competition](https://csdb.dk/event/?id=3043) on the [Commodore 64 Scene
Database](https://csdb.dk/event/?id=3043), which was organised by
[Stinsen](https://csdb.dk/scener/?id=23584). The challenge was to come up with a
melody for a short little tune that Stinsen made.

This was the starting point:

[Last night, by
Stinsen](https://deepsid.chordian.net/?file=SID%20Happens/Last_Night.sid)

We had a lot of fun and learned a lot while making this tune, but we didn't
really expect to end up very high. We actually got into a neck-on-neck race to
the top with our all time hero and SID music veteran [Thomas "Laxity" Egeskov
Petersen](https://csdb.dk/scener/?id=677) though! Finally, Thomas walked away
with the well deserved #1 position, and we became second! Check out all the kind
words we received on the [Commodore 64 Scene
Database](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=202260).
