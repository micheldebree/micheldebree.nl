A short tune I made on the Commodore 64 using [DMC
5.1+](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=2600). ~~As far as I know it has never been used
in any Commodore 64 productions.~~ It has been used in this little [fireworks
display](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=198660).

You can also find it on
[DeepSID](https://deepsid.chordian.net/?file=/MUSICIANS/H/HeatWave/youtH/Bosswing.sid).
The styling of the video was done using [Retropixels](/posts/retropixels-0-7-1/)
