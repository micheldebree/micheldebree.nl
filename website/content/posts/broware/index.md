After having made a tune for Vandalism News #72 ([Sunkissed](/posts/sunkissed)),
this time I cooperated on a tune with Thomas Egeskov Petersen
([Laxity](https://csdb.dk/scener/?id=677)) and Sanke Michael Choe
([SMC](https://csdb.dk/scener/?id=1283)) for [Vandalism News
#73](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=225729).

Even though my contribution is pretty minimal, it was good fun working with
these guys because I am a big fan of their music, and they are very cool guys on
top of that! 

Vandalism News is a digital magazine about the Commodore 64 Demoscene, which
runs on the Commodore 64. It contains a jukebox of tunes to listen to while
reading.
