I did a little update on the Terminator theme from [Big Angry
Sprite](/posts/big_angry_sprite/). It is made for
[Honcho](https://csdb.dk/scener/?id=34209)'s entry for the [Skull Animation
Compo](https://csdb.dk/event/?id=3135) on CSDB:
[Endoskull](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=211929).  I did not have much time, but
I think this version is somewhat of an improvement. And guess what, this little
production won 1st place!

P.S. the movie above is taken from the [Anniversary
Edition](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=212309), which was released
after the competition, and adds a nice opening title screen.
