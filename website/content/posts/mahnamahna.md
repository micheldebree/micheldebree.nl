Pssst... I made the soundtrack to [this Commodore 64
demo](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=203377), but I did it incognito. Don't tell
anyone!

A friend of mine told me about a little side project he wanted to start on the
demoscene, called [Mahna Mahna](https://csdb.dk/group/?id=11339), doing
Muppetshow themed demos. He would do the coding under the handle "Statler", and
someone else would to the graphics as "Waldorf". Could I do a cover of the tune
"Mahna Mahna" that was made famous by The Muppetshow? Of course I would like to
give that a go! I would have to come up with Muppets themed handle too, so I
chose Animal, the weird and wild drummer in the Muppets band.

I am not a big fan of the version by The Muppetshow, but I do like the original
by Piero Umiliani:
