Rather than being religious about techniques and methodologies, I let the
experience and intuition I have acquired over the years guide my my daily work.
Some guidelines:

- **Purpose**; software should serve a real purpose other than make the coder
  look smart or pay for his/her mortgage
- **Sustainability**; software should be maintainable, scalable, secure and
  adaptable. To both your future self as to other developers. Software is never
  finished, only abandoned.
- **Ownership**; take responsibility of what you made. Don't point your finger
  when things don't work, but take control of the solution even if somebody else
  screwed up.
- **Minimalism**; leverage existing software because _code is where the bugs
  hide_. Write as little code as possible, _but not less_.
- **Efficiency**; IT resources are expensive, don't over consume. Measure
  performance, fix the bottlenecks and be very sceptical about premature
  optimization. 
- **Hygiene**; write readable, adaptable code, but don't obsess over it.
  Sometimes duplication makes code more adaptable. Sometimes a well-documented
  hack is the right thing at the right moment.
- **Criticism**; be your own worse critic. Give and embrace constructive
  criticism.
- **Scepticism**; don't trust your solution but instead do your best to try and
  break it. Don't assume but verify. To be safe, don't trust anything or anyone
  except Murphy's law.
- **Intrinsic gratification**; get your kick from working solutions and user
  satisfaction, not from ego boosting, job title, politics or perks.
- **Automation over documentation**; code doesn't lie. Documentation often does.
- **Untested features are broken by default**. A feature without a test is not a
  feature but an unreliable side-effect. Fix it before you ship it.

These guidelines can often be conflicting in practice. That is where
experience and common sense comes in to help you make the right choices.
