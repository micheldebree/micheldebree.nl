Welcome to my website. In this first post I will go over some details on how
this site was created.

- The site is static HTML, generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)
- Sourcecode is accessible on [Github](https://github.com/micheldebree/website)
- The generated HTML is hosted on [Github pages](https://pages.github.com)
- Based on the [hugo-coder](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-coder) theme

So, I didn't use a fancy CMS like Wordpress, or a platform like Medium for
example. Why is that?

- I don't need fancy stuff that requires session management, a database,
  authorization etc. I just need to **publish** information.
- Static HTML is fast, robust and secure.
- Content is just Markdown files on my laptop. They are easily accessible, lots
  of editors support Markdown, and it is easily portable.
- The generated site is easily portable to any HTTP server without further
  dependencies.
- I am leveraging my knowledge of Git, Markdown, HTML and CSS, all widely used
  and community supported.
- I am a developer and actually like using text editors and command line over
  GUI's.
- I am using free open-source tooling and free hosting. Because I'm a cheapo and
  have an irrational fear of vendor lock-in.
- I don't need thousands of followers. I am glad _you_ are here though!

## The setup

This is how I did it

- [I installed Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing) on my laptop.
  I use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) on macOS, so:

  ```bash
  brew install hugo
  ```

- I have a [Github](https://github.com) account, where I created

  - a **source** repository for my Hugo website configuration and content,
      called [`website`](https://github.com/micheldebree/website)
  - a **target** [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) repository for my
      generated site called
      [`micheldebree.github.io`](https://github.com/micheldebree/micheldebree.github.io)
      (the naming convention for personal Github Pages). The site is served from
      this repository.

  This is because Github personal pages cannot be served from a subfolder in the
  repository. `hugo` generates the static website in the subfolder `public`, so
  I cannot make do with just one repository for source and target.

- In the **source** repository `website`, I created the initial website by
  following the [Hugo quickstart
  documentation](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/).

- Now a trick to generate the website that ends up in the `public` folder,
  directly into the root of the **target** repository; checkout the **target**
  repository as a submodule of the **source** repository, with the name
  `public`:

  ```bash
  cd website
  rm -rf ./public
  git submodule add https://github.com/micheldebree/micheldebree.github.io.git public
  ```

Now I'm ready to install a theme, tweak things to my liking, and start my first
post.

### Custom domain with HTTPS

As you may have noticed, this site is not served from `micheldebree.github.io`.
That is because I setup Github Pages to use my own domain name. Check out the
[documentation](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)
on how to do that. Basically you need to:

- Setup the DNS records at your domain provider to point to the Github servers.
- Add a file called `CNAME` to the root of your site. Because `hugo` copies
  everything in the `static` folder verbatim to the root of the generated site,
  I created the file `static/CNAME` with the following content:

  ```bash
  www.micheldebree.nl
  ```

- The best part: Github takes care of the `https` automatically, so visitors
  will see a green lock in their browser!

### Build and publish the website

I now have one `website` repository to work in, with a submodule for the
generated website. So when I make changes, I usually do a push to both
repositories:

When I made some changes that I want to commit:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Finally finished my first blog post"
git push
```

This pushes the changes to the **source** repository, but doesn't push the site
that is served from `micheldebree.github.io`

If I want to publish the changes:

```bash
hugo
cd public
git add .
git commit -m "Finally finished my first blog post"
git push
```

This generates the website in the `public` folder and pushes it to the
**target** repository, where Github serves it to the world.

You can see how this could easily be more automated, but for now it works fine
for me.
