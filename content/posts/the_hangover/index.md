It has been about 30 years since [Yavin](https://csdb.dk/scener/?id=1126) and I
collaborated on a [Commodore 64](/tags/c64) tune, so to celebrate, here is a new
tune!

This is our entry to the [Last Night melody
compo](https://csdb.dk/event/?id=3043) on
[CSDB](https://csdb.dk/event/?id=3043), a competition organised by
[Stinsen](https://csdb.dk/scener/?id=23584). The challenge was to come up with a
melody for a short little tune that Stinsen made. A lot of freedom is permitted,
as long as the original chord progression is recognizable.

This was the starting point:

[Last night, by
Stinsen](https://deepsid.chordian.net/?file=SID%20Happens/Last_Night.sid)
[(mp3)](stinsen-last_night.mp3)

And this is our version:


[The Hangover (after last night with Stinsen), by Yavin, Youth and Stinsen](https://deepsid.chordian.net/?file=/SID%20Happens/The_Hangover.sid)
[(mp3)](heatwave_and_stinsen-the_hangover.mp3)

I also made a title screen to look at when you listen to the tune on a Commodore
64, which can be found on [CSDB: The Hangover](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=202260)
