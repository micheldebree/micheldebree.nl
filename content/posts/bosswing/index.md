A short tune I made on the Commodore 64 using [DMC 5.1+](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=2600). As far as I know it has never been used in any Commodore 64 productions.

You can also find it on
[DeepSID](https://deepsid.chordian.net/?file=/MUSICIANS/H/HeatWave/youtH/Bosswing.sid). The styling of the video was done using [Retropixels](/posts/retropixels-0-7-1)
