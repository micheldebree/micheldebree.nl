This is our (me and my mate Marvin) entry to the
[X'97 Takeover](http://www.takeover.nl/edition97/) music competition.

I started the tune at home and then finished it together with Marvin under
less than ideal circumstances at the party place itself. It's certainly a
little rough around the edges and basicly unfinished, but hey, there was a
deadline and we made it!

We ended up getting a big applause and a low ranking in the results. But we
had fun making it, which is all that counts!
